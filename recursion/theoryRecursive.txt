 
 -> identify if you can break down it into smaller problem
 
 -> write the recurence relation if needed

 
 -> draw the recursive  tree

 
 -> about the tree 

   --> see the flow of function how they are getting in stack

   --> identify and flows of left tree calls and right tree calls

   --> draw the tree and pointing again and again using pen and paper

   --> use the debugger to see the flow
       
   --> see how the values are returened at each step

   -->  see where the function call will come out of 

   --> see how the values and what types of values (int , string, etc)

   --> see where the function will come out at the end , you will come out of the main function


   ---> variable --> argument
                 --> return type
                 --> body of function
